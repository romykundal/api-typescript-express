# romykundal.dev api-typescript-express
A clean and minimal starter project for Node.js, Express.js, and TypeScript, ideal for small to medium-sized applications.

Designed with simplicity and scalability in mind, this boilerplate offers a solid foundation for personal or MVP projects.

While larger applications may require additional folder structuring, this template is easily extensible and flexible enough to evolve with your project‚Äôs needs.

## Features
Most of the essential features are pre-configured to streamline setup, letting you focus on development rather than boilerplate. Additional packages are also included to accelerate your project from the get-go.

Full TypeScript support for type-safe development

Jest pre-configured for seamless testing with TypeScript

Async/await-ready with built-in error handling middleware

Database/ORM agnostic, allowing flexible integration

Path aliases for cleaner and maintainable imports

Nodemon for automatic server restarts on file changes

Optimized production build with dedicated scripts (no ts-node in prod)

Pre-configured security middlewares for safer applications

Environment variables autoloaded, ready for multi-environment configs

# Setup

## Important helper functions

### asyncHandler
Passing middleware into the asyncHandler will allow the server to automatically catch any internal server errors, or manually thrown errors from the server. 
```js
// ? asyncHandler should be used for every request for easy async handling
export const getUsers = asyncHandler(
  async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    // Example user, get from database
    const user = [{ name: "romy kundal" }, { name: "romy Gharota" }];

    // Return json with success message
    res.status(200).json(new ApiSuccess<User[]>(user, "Success!"));
  },
);
```

## ApiError & ApiSucccess
Using ApiError or ApiSuccess allows for consistent responses across all routes; please use this instead of passing your own data structure. 

### ApiError
```js
 throw new ApiError({}, 500, "Handled by asyncHandler")
```

### ApiSuccess
```js
 res.status(200).json(new ApiSuccess<User[]>(user, "Success!"));
```

## Adding extra path aliases
If you add extra folders to this template and would like to use them with aliases, then go through following:

1. Go into ```tsconfig.json```
2. Add extra paths inside of ```{ paths: ... }``` (for tsconfig-paths)
3. Go into ```package.json```
4. Add extra paths inside of ```{_moduleAliases: ... }``` (for production build)
